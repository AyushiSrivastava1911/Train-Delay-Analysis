# Train Delay Analysis

**Tools:** SQL, Python, Power BI  

**Description:**  
Analyzed train delay data using SQL queries and Python for data cleaning. Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to identify delay patterns, common causes, and trends across different routes.  

**Key Insights:**  
- A significant percentage of trains experienced delays, with peak delays during night hours. 
- 95.77% trains delayed, only 4.23% on time.
- Rainy weather was identified as the leading cause of train delays.
- Average delay times varied across weekdays, with Mondays and Thursdays showing the highest impact.
